## üìö Usage

### Loading Configuration

- **From Local Storage**: If a saved configuration is present in local storage, TreeMapPulse will automatically load it upon startup. This ensures your previous session's data is readily available.
- **From API**: If no local configuration is found, you can easily load a sample configuration by clicking the "Load Sample Data" button. This allows you to quickly start working with a predefined setup.

### Importing and Exporting Data

- **Import**:
  - Navigate to the configuration panel.
  - Click the upload button to import project data from a JSON file.
  - Select your JSON file from the file dialog. The imported data will replace the current configuration, allowing you to seamlessly continue your work.
- **Export**:
  - In the configuration panel, click the save button.
  - This will export the current project data to a JSON file, preserving your work and enabling easy sharing and backup.

### Managing Projects

- **Adding/Updating Statuses**:
  - Open the configuration panel to manage statuses.
  - You can add new statuses to categorize tasks more effectively, update existing ones to reflect changes in your workflow, or remove obsolete statuses.
- **Updating Tasks**:
  - Click on any task to cycle through its statuses.
  - This intuitive interface allows for quick updates, ensuring your project board accurately reflects the current state of each task.

### JSON Configuration Format

The JSON configuration file should adhere to the following structure to be compatible with TreeMapPulse:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "project-1",
    "name": "Project 1",
    "children": [
      {
        "key": "task-1",
        "name": "Task 1",
        "status": "In Progress",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "key": "task-2",
        "name": "Task 2",
        "status": "Done",
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

- `key`: A unique identifier for the section or task, ensuring each element is distinct.
- `name`: The name of the section or task, providing a clear label for easy identification.
- `status`: The current status of the section or task (e.g., "In Progress", "Done"), allowing for effective tracking and categorization.
- `children`: An array of nested sections or tasks, supporting hierarchical project structures.
- `isCollapsed` (optional): A boolean flag indicating whether the section should be collapsed, helping to manage the visibility of complex structures.

By following this guide, you can effectively utilize TreeMapPulse to manage your projects, import/export data seamlessly, and maintain a well-organized JSON configuration.
